          During this second phase, the teams must download the data anonymized
          by the other teams during phase 1 and try to re-identify as much data
          as possible. The attack file takes the form of a JSON file. The JSON
          file is composed of the IDs of the original file, a year and a week
          number corresponding to the{" "}
          <span className="underline">ISO calendar</span> and finally one or
          more proposals for anonymized identifiers.

          Each team can propose several answers for each week number, but in
          this case, if a correct answer is among the proposals, the point will
          be divided by the number of proposals.

            Once as much data as possible has been de-anonymized, the attack
            must be sent. And this for each file anonymized by the other teams.
            A <strong>maximum of 10 attacks per submission</strong> is allowed.
            The different teams thus obtain an attack score corresponding to the
            percentage of de-anonymized identification for each submission. If
            several attacks are made on the same submission, the best one is
            retained.
